# Human-Robot Interaction Transcripts Dataset

This repository contains a dataset of transcripts from human-robot interactions collected in a Wizard of Oz setting. The interactions cover three different scenarios and have been annotated for clarification types with spans.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes transcripts of conversations between humans and a robot, where the robot's responses were controlled by a human operator. The three scenarios are designed to capture a variety of interaction contexts:

1. **Scenario 1: Turn Around for QR Code Scanning**
2. **Scenario 2: Check if the Light is On or Off in a Seprate Room**
3. **Scenario 3: Get a Book from a Separate Room**

### Annotations

Each transcript is annotated with the following details:

- **Clarification Turns**: Turns that include clarification dialogue
- **Clarification Types**: Types of clarifications requested during the interaction.
- **Spans**: The exact segments of text where the clarifications occur.

## Data Format

The dataset is organized into directories, with annotations provided in JSON and XML format.

## Usage

To use this dataset, clone the repository and load the transcripts and annotations into your analysis tool of choice.

# Conversational Interfaces: Practice
This repository is made for the Conversational Interfaces: Practice study on clarfication dialogues.
